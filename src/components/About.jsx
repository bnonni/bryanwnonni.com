                                        <p>My name is Bryan. I graduated from The University of Georgia in 2014 with a Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies, and then I worked in digital marketing for 4 years.</p>
                                        <p>In 2014, I first heard the term "Bitcoin," and after a brief and broken explanation from a friend, I dismissed the idea. It wasn't until 2016 when I started to self-teach coding that I heard the term blockchain and became curious. From 2016 to 2017, I took 2 coding bootcamps and began building websites as a "side hustle." During this time, I also started online courses on "what is a blockchain" and "how to build your own cryptocurrency." At that time, I knew 0 java, and realized, I needed to go back to school.</p>
                                        <p>From 2017 to 2019, I worked full time and went to school at Georgia State part-time for a Computer Science degree. Finally, in 2019, I decided to quit my job and complete my CS degree at Ga State full time. I graduated from Georgia State University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in December 2019 and subsequently took at job at NCR in the Innovation Lab as a Software Engineer I.</p>
                                        <p>Over the past 2 years at NCR, the majority of my focus has been on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies researching topics, developing ideas into IDRs, building those ideas into PoCs and working my way into a Blockchain and Crypto Tech Lead position in the Lab. In December 2021, I accepted a new role as a Software Engineer II on the newly acquired LibertyX production software team.</p>
