                                            My name is Bryan. I graduated from
                                            The University of Georgia in 2014
                                            with a Bachelor of Arts in
                                            Communication Studies, and then I
                                            worked in digital marketing for 4
                                            years.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            In 2014, I first heard the term
                                            "Bitcoin," and after a brief and
                                            broken explanation from a friend, I
                                            dismissed the idea. It wasn't until
                                            2016 when I started to self-teach
                                            coding that I heard the term
                                            blockchain and became curious. From
                                            2016 to 2017, I took 2 coding
                                            bootcamps and began building
                                            websites as a "side hustle." During
                                            this time, I also started online
                                            courses on "what is a blockchain"
                                            and "how to build your own
                                            cryptocurrency." At that time, I
                                            knew 0 java, and realized, I needed
                                            to go back to school.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            From 2017 to 2019, I worked full
                                            time and went to school at Georgia
                                            State part-time for a Computer
                                            Science degree. Finally, in 2019, I
                                            decided to quit my job and complete
                                            my CS degree at Ga State full time.
                                            I graduated from Georgia State
                                            University with a Bachelor of
                                            Science in Computer Science in
                                            December 2019 and subsequently took
                                            at job at NCR in the Innovation Lab
                                            as a Software Engineer I.

                                            Over the past 2 years at NCR, the
                                            majority of my focus has been on
                                            blockchain technology and
                                            cryptocurrencies researching topics,
                                            developing ideas into IDRs, building
                                            those ideas into PoCs and working my
                                            way into a Blockchain and Crypto
                                            Tech Lead position in the Lab. In
                                            December 2021, I accepted a new role
                                            as a Software Engineer II on the
